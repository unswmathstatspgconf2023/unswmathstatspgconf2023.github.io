    <h2>Research Translation in All Its Forms</h2>
    <p>
        This year's Postgraduate Conference will feature a range of student talks over the day, showcasing the diverse and innovative research flowing from our Master's and PhD student cohorts. The schedule includes longer plenary sessions and talks by students that have recently been presented at overseas conferences. The day provides an opportunity for our postgraduate research students to present the research they are currently working on. We will also host an after-party for all attendees in the Colombo Building's foyer.
