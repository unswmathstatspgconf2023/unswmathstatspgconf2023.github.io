    <h2 style="text-align: center;font-size:20.0pt">Theme: Research Translation in All Its Forms</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Research translation encompasses the systematic and interdisciplinary process of narrowing the divide between scientific knowledge and its practical application across multiple domains. It entails the efficient conversion of research findings into concrete outcomes that can yield societal benefits. This process encompasses diverse modalities, including knowledge dissemination, technology transfer, implementation science, and dissemination strategies. From a scientific standpoint, research translation seeks to optimise the transfer of knowledge by employing rigorous methodologies and evidence-based practices, while considering contextual factors and engaging relevant stakeholders. By actively fostering the integration of research findings into policies, programs, and interventions, research translation facilitates the expeditious advancement of scientific knowledge, fosters innovation, and maximises the societal impact of scientific discoveries.
